# React Router Migration Guide

This document explains the changes made to address React Router warnings and resource preloading issues.

## Changes Made

### 1. Migrated to Data Router API

We've migrated from using `BrowserRouter` to the newer Data Router API with `createBrowserRouter` and `RouterProvider`. This approach:

- Provides better performance
- Enables future flags for React Router v7 compatibility
- Follows the recommended pattern for React Router v6.4+

### 2. Enabled React Router v7 Future Flags

We've enabled the following future flags to prepare for React Router v7:

- `v7_startTransition`: React Router will wrap state updates in `React.startTransition` for better performance
- `v7_relativeSplatPath`: Changes how relative paths are resolved within splat routes

### 3. Resource Preloading Optimization

We've optimized the resource preloading in `index.html` to address the warning:

> The resource was preloaded using link preload but not used within a few seconds from the window's load event.

- Removed unnecessary preload directives
- Kept only essential preconnect directives
- Used prefetch for non-critical assets

## Files Modified

1. `src/index.js` - Updated to use RouterProvider
2. `src/App.js` - Removed BrowserRouter wrapper
3. `src/router.js` - New file with createBrowserRouter configuration
4. `public/index.html` - Optimized resource loading directives

## How to Apply These Changes

1. Install the updated dependencies:

```bash
cd CashHeros
npm install
```

2. Start the development server:

```bash
npm run start
```

## Future Considerations

When React Router v7 is released, we should:

1. Review the migration guide
2. Remove the future flags (as they'll be the default behavior)
3. Update any code that might be affected by the breaking changes
