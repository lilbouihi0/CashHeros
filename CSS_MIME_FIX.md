# CSS MIME Type Fix

This document explains how to fix the CSS MIME type issue and other related problems in the CashHeros application.

## Problem

The application was experiencing the following issues:

1. CSS files were not loading correctly because they were being served with the wrong MIME type (`text/html` instead of `text/css`).
2. React warnings about using `UNSAFE_componentWillMount` in strict mode (related to react-helmet).
3. Error loading CashBackPage with "originalFactory is undefined" error.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Simple Server with Standalone HTML (Recommended)

We've created a simple server that serves standalone HTML files with inline CSS:

- `simple-server.js` - A lightweight server that serves static HTML files
- `temp-index.html` - A temporary landing page with inline CSS
- `cashback-standalone.html` - A standalone CashBack page with inline CSS

This approach completely bypasses the CSS MIME type issue and the React errors by using pure HTML/CSS/JS.

### 2. CSS MIME Type Fix (Alternative)

We've also created enhanced server scripts that attempt to fix the MIME type issues:

- `css-fix-server.js` - A standalone server that serves the application with correct MIME types
- `dev-server.js` - A proxy server that forwards requests to the React development server and fixes MIME types

### 3. CashBackPage Fix (Alternative)

We've created a simplified CashBackPage component that doesn't rely on the problematic StoreContext:

- `SimpleCashBackPage.jsx` - A standalone component that uses hardcoded data

## How to Run the Application

### Option 1: Simple Server (Recommended)

The easiest way to run the application without any issues is to use the simple server:

```bash
npm run start:simple
```

This will:
1. Start a simple server on port 3000
2. Serve static HTML files with inline CSS
3. No CSS MIME type issues or React errors

You can access:
- Home page: http://localhost:3000
- CashBack page: http://localhost:3000/cashback

### Option 2: Using the CSS Fix Script (Alternative)

If you want to try the React application with CSS fixes:

```bash
npm run start:css-fix
```

This will:
1. Start the React development server on port 3000
2. Start the CSS fix proxy server on port 3001
3. Open your browser to http://localhost:3001

## Troubleshooting

If you still encounter issues:

1. Use the simple server option (`npm run start:simple`)
2. Clear your browser cache
3. Try a different browser
4. Check the console for specific error messages

## Technical Details

The simple server approach works by:
1. Serving static HTML files with inline CSS (no external CSS files)
2. Using vanilla JavaScript instead of React
3. Providing a clean, working interface without the complexity of the React application
