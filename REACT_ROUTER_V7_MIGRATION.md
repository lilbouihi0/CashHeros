# React Router v7 Migration Guide

This document explains the comprehensive changes made to address React Router warnings and prepare for React Router v7.

## Changes Made

### 1. Complete Migration to Data Router API

We've fully migrated from the legacy `BrowserRouter` to the modern Data Router API:

- Created `appRouter.js` using `createBrowserRouter` and `createRoutesFromElements`
- Updated `index.js` to use `RouterProvider` with the new router
- Removed `BrowserRouter` from `App.js`

### 2. Multiple Approaches to Enable Future Flags

We've implemented several approaches to ensure the future flags are properly enabled:

1. **Router Configuration Level**:
   ```javascript
   createBrowserRouter(routes, {
     future: {
       v7_startTransition: true,
       v7_relativeSplatPath: true
     }
   });
   ```

2. **Global Configuration Level**:
   ```javascript
   // In routerConfig.js
   window.__reactRouterFuture = {
     v7_startTransition: true,
     v7_relativeSplatPath: true
   };
   ```

3. **Updated to Latest React Router Version**:
   ```json
   "react-router-dom": "^6.22.3"
   ```

### 3. Resource Preloading Optimization

We've optimized the resource preloading in `index.html` to address the warning:

> The resource was preloaded using link preload but not used within a few seconds from the window's load event.

- Removed all `preload` directives that were causing warnings
- Kept only essential `preconnect` directives
- Used `prefetch` for non-critical assets

## Files Modified

1. `src/index.js` - Updated to use RouterProvider and import router configuration
2. `src/App.js` - Removed BrowserRouter wrapper and updated imports
3. `src/appRouter.js` - New file with createBrowserRouter configuration
4. `src/routerConfig.js` - New file with global future flags configuration
5. `public/index.html` - Optimized resource loading directives
6. `package.json` - Updated React Router DOM to latest version

## How to Apply These Changes

1. Install the updated dependencies:

```bash
cd CashHeros
npm install
```

2. Start the development server:

```bash
npm run start
```

## Future Considerations

When React Router v7 is released, we should:

1. Review the migration guide
2. Remove the future flags (as they'll be the default behavior)
3. Update any code that might be affected by the breaking changes
