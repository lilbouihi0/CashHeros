# Security Measures

This document outlines the security measures implemented in the CashHeros application to protect user data and prevent common web vulnerabilities.

## Authentication & Authorization

- **JWT Authentication**: Secure token-based authentication with short expiry times
- **Refresh Tokens**: Implemented with secure, HTTP-only cookies
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Different permission levels for users and administrators
- **Two-Factor Authentication**: Optional 2FA for additional account security

## Data Protection

- **Input Sanitization**: All user inputs are sanitized to prevent XSS attacks
- **Data Validation**: Comprehensive validation using Joi for all API requests
- **MongoDB Injection Prevention**: Using express-mongo-sanitize to prevent NoSQL injection
- **HTTPS Only**: All communications are encrypted using TLS/SSL

## API Security

- **CSRF Protection**: Using double submit cookie pattern to prevent CSRF attacks
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents brute force and DoS attacks
- **API Key Authentication**: For external service integrations
- **Request Size Limiting**: Prevents request flooding

## HTTP Security Headers

- **Content-Security-Policy**: Restricts which resources can be loaded
- **X-Content-Type-Options**: Prevents MIME type sniffing
- **X-Frame-Options**: Prevents clickjacking attacks
- **Strict-Transport-Security**: Forces HTTPS connections
- **X-XSS-Protection**: Enables browser's built-in XSS filters
- **Permissions-Policy**: Controls browser feature permissions

## CORS Configuration

- **Restricted Origins**: Only allows requests from whitelisted domains
- **Credentials Support**: Securely handles cookies in cross-origin requests
- **Preflight Caching**: Optimizes CORS preflight requests

## Dependency Security

- **Regular Updates**: Dependencies are regularly updated to patch vulnerabilities
- **Security Scanning**: Using tools like npm audit to identify vulnerable packages

## Monitoring & Logging

- **Error Logging**: Structured logging for security events
- **Rate Limit Monitoring**: Alerts for suspicious activity
- **Failed Authentication Tracking**: Monitors for potential brute force attempts

## Implementation Details

### CSRF Protection

The application uses a double submit cookie pattern for CSRF protection:

1. A CSRF token is generated and stored in an HTTP-only cookie
2. The same token is sent to the client via a custom header
3. For state-changing requests (POST, PUT, DELETE), the client must include the token in the request header
4. The server validates that the token in the cookie matches the token in the header

### Rate Limiting

Rate limiting is implemented at multiple levels:

1. Global rate limiting for all API endpoints
2. Stricter rate limiting for authentication endpoints
3. Per-API key rate limiting for external services

### Input Validation & Sanitization

All user inputs go through a multi-layer validation and sanitization process:

1. Data validation using Joi schemas
2. HTML sanitization using sanitize-html
3. MongoDB query sanitization using express-mongo-sanitize

### API Key Authentication

External services must authenticate using API keys:

1. Keys are service-specific and rate-limited
2. Keys can be revoked or rotated as needed
3. Usage is logged for auditing purposes

## Security Best Practices for Developers

1. Never store sensitive information in client-side code
2. Always validate and sanitize user inputs
3. Use parameterized queries for database operations
4. Keep dependencies updated
5. Follow the principle of least privilege
6. Implement proper error handling that doesn't expose sensitive information
7. Use secure password hashing (bcrypt)
8. Regularly rotate secrets and keys
