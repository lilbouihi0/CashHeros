## Bundle Size Optimization

We've implemented several techniques to reduce the bundle size:

- **Code Splitting**: The application now uses dynamic imports to split the code into smaller chunks that are loaded on demand.
- **Tree Shaking**: Unused code is automatically removed during the build process.
- **Webpack Bundle Analyzer**: Added a script to analyze the bundle size and identify large dependencies.
- **Dependency Optimization**: Reviewed and optimized dependencies to reduce overall bundle size.

To analyze the bundle:
```bash
npm run build:analyze
```

## Lazy Loading

Components and routes are now lazy-loaded to improve initial load time:

- **Route-based Code Splitting**: Each route loads its own JavaScript bundle.
- **Component Lazy Loading**: Heavy components are loaded only when needed.
- **Prefetching**: Critical routes are prefetched during idle time.
- **Error Handling**: Fallback components are displayed if lazy-loaded components fail to load.

## Image Optimization

Images are now optimized for faster loading:

- **Lazy Loading Images**: Images below the fold are loaded only when they come into view.
- **Responsive Images**: Different image sizes are served based on the device screen size.
- **WebP Format**: Modern image formats are used when supported by the browser.
- **Image Compression**: Images are automatically compressed during the build process.
- **Placeholder Images**: Low-resolution placeholders are shown while images load.

## Caching Strategy

We've implemented a comprehensive caching strategy:

- **Service Worker**: Caches static assets for offline use.
- **Cache Headers**: Proper cache headers are set for all static assets.
- **Cache Busting**: File names include content hashes to ensure cache invalidation when content changes.
- **Selective Caching**: Different cache strategies for different types of content.

## Offline Capabilities

The application now works offline:

- **Service Worker**: Handles offline requests and provides cached responses.
- **Background Sync**: Queues failed requests to be retried when online.
- **Offline UI**: Shows appropriate UI when the user is offline.
- **PWA Support**: The app can be installed as a Progressive Web App.

## Performance Monitoring

We've added tools to monitor performance:

- **Web Vitals**: Tracks Core Web Vitals metrics.
- **Performance Logging**: Logs performance metrics for analysis.
- **User Timing API**: Measures critical rendering paths.
- **Error Tracking**: Captures and reports performance-related errors.

## CSS Optimization

CSS delivery has been optimized:

- **Critical CSS**: Inlines critical CSS in the HTML.
- **CSS Code Splitting**: CSS is split per route to reduce initial CSS size.
- **CSS Minification**: CSS is minified and optimized during build.
- **Unused CSS Removal**: Removes unused CSS rules.
- **CSS Loading Strategy**: Non-critical CSS is loaded asynchronously.

## Build Process Improvements

The build process has been enhanced:

- **Source Maps**: Disabled in production to reduce file size.
- **Minification**: Enhanced minification for JavaScript and CSS.
- **Compression**: Gzip/Brotli compression for all static assets.
- **Tree Shaking**: Improved configuration for better dead code elimination.
- **Parallel Processing**: Build tasks run in parallel when possible.

## How to Measure Performance

To measure the performance improvements:

1. **Lighthouse**: Run Lighthouse audits in Chrome DevTools.
2. **WebPageTest**: Use [WebPageTest](https://www.webpagetest.org/) for detailed performance analysis.
3. **Chrome DevTools**: Use the Performance and Network tabs to analyze loading performance.
4. **Web Vitals**: Check the console for Web Vitals metrics in development.

## Future Improvements

Planned future optimizations:

- **Server-Side Rendering**: Implement SSR for faster initial page loads.
- **HTTP/2 Push**: Utilize HTTP/2 server push for critical assets.
- **Font Optimization**: Further optimize font loading and rendering.
- **Preconnect to Critical Origins**: Add preconnect hints for third-party domains.
- **Resource Hints**: Implement more resource hints (preload, prefetch, preconnect).
